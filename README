check_vcs - A Nagios Check for Veritas Cluster Server

check_vcs is currently only useful for checking if a Service Group is ONLINE or FAULTED.

Currently the user executing the script has to have sudo privileges for running
hastatus.  If I can figure out a way to do away with that dependency I will.

Also if the check is being passed to check_by_ssh you will need to turn off the
default requirement (on RHEL/Cent/Fedora and possibly others) for a tty to use
sudo. 

Example addition to /etc/sudoers:

  Defaults:nagios !requiretty
  nagios ALL=NOPASSWD: /opt/VRTSvcs/bin/hastatus
